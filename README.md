# Signature Detection Model Assignment

This project involves developing an object detection model to accurately detect signatures in images using YOLOv8. The goal is to annotate a dataset, apply data augmentation, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Objective
To create a robust object detection model for signature detection using YOLOv8. The process includes data annotation, augmentation, training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

1. *Data Annotation*: Annotate the provided dataset for training the model.
2. *Data Augmentation*: Apply augmentation techniques to enhance the model's robustness.
3. *Model Selection*: Use YOLOv8 for model training.
4. *Model Training*: Train YOLOv8 on the annotated and augmented dataset.
5. *Evaluation*: Test and evaluate the model's performance using a separate validation/test set.
